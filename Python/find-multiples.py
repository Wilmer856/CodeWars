# DESCRIPTION:
# In this simple exercise, you will build a program that takes a value,
# integer , and returns a list of its multiples up to another value, limit .
# If limit is a multiple of integer, it should be included as well.
# There will only ever be positive integers passed into the function,
# not consisting of 0. The limit will always be higher than the base.

# For example, if the parameters passed are (2, 6),
# the function should return [2, 4, 6] as 2, 4, and 6 are the multiples of 2 up to 6.

def find_multiples(integer, limit):
    return [num for num in range(integer,limit+1) if num % integer == 0]

# The function uses a list comprehension to generate a list of numbers in
# the specified range (integer to limit) that are multiples of the given integer.
